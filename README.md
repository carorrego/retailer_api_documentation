Dear partner,

You made it - in front of you lies the most loved API in the transporation industry. Actually, so far it is mostly the love of our dev and product team, due to it being super brand new, but we hope you will fall in love soon too. Feel free to write to me personally anytime at [partner@distribusion.com](mailto:partner@distribusion.com) in case you are unhappy or our baby is not behaving as you expected.

You can trust on us working hard everyday to make it your most loved product.

Your Distribusion IT team

You can use our API to access Distribusion content and book bus rides. We have put a lot of thought into making it as easy as possible to integrate with us. Have fun and share your feedback with us!

In this new API, Distribusion aims to standardize the stations codes across the bus industry, the same way IATA did in the flight industry. Our station codes are designed to represent specific locations using a set of 8 capital letters. The construction of such code follow a simple logic:

- The first two letters represent the country
- The next three, the city in which the station is located
- The last three letters represent a more precise location

Example: GBLONVSA - Great Britain / London / Victoria station

When integrating and testing our API, please use the following URL: `https://api-demo.distribusion.com/retailers/v3`
Documentation for the API v2 can still be found at [https://api-demo.distribusion.com/reseller/v2/docs](https://api-demo.distribusion.com/reseller/v2/docs)
