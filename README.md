<p align="center">Welcome to Distribusion API! You can use our API to access Distribusion content and book bus rides. We have put a lot of thoughts into making it as easy as possible to integrate with us. Have fun and share your feedback with us! Documentation for the API v2 can still be found at <a href="https://api-demo.distribusion.com/reseller/v2/docs">Distribusion API</a>

We have language bindings in Shell and Ruby! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

When integrating and testing on our API, please use the following URL: <a href="https://api-demo.distribusion.com/retailers/v3">https://api-demo.distribusion.com/retailers/v3</a>
